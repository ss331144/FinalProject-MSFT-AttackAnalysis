# Video Compression Notice

To ensure smooth and efficient upload to GitHub, we have compressed the original video file by reducing its quality and overall file size. 

This compression helps to:

- Minimize storage space usage on the repository.
- Decrease upload and download times.
- Maintain a reasonable balance between video quality and file size.

The compression was performed using Python with the FFmpeg library, applying bitrate adjustment and resolution scaling techniques.

**Note:** Due to this compression, the video quality is lower than the original. If you require the full-quality video, please contact the repository maintainer.
