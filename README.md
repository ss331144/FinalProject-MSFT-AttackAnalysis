## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to our final data science project! This is a deep dive into the world of cybersecurity, focusing specifically on Microsoft-related attacks and vulnerabilities. Using a massive, real-world dataset from Microsoft‚Äôs security bulletins and the GUIDE dataset, we aim to uncover patterns, predict attack likelihoods, and help improve defenses through machine learning.

Why this project? Cybersecurity is one of the hottest and most critical fields today. With cyberattacks growing in sophistication and scale, understanding how and why attacks happen ‚Äî especially targeting widely used platforms like Microsoft ‚Äî can save organizations millions and protect countless users. Our project analyzes over **23,000** real incidents and **43** data features, ranging from CVE identifiers to attack complexity and exploitability scores.

We built a robust pipeline that covers everything from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to applying and comparing advanced ML models such as Random Forest, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and even cutting-edge neural nets like TabNet. Our goal: to identify which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited and to find the best predictive models.

This work not only enhances academic knowledge but can also serve as a foundation for practical cybersecurity threat intelligence systems.
