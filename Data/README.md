# Project Structure Overview

The **FinalProject-MSFT-AttackAnalysis** repository is organized to clearly separate raw data, supporting documentation, and additional files that enrich the analysis process.

| Folder Name               | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Data/`                   | Contains the main raw datasets with Microsoft security bulletins spanning multiple years.      |
| `Data Analysis/`          | Includes an Excel file that provides detailed explanations and descriptions of each data feature (metadata). |
| `Search Across Bulletins/`| Contains supplementary files downloaded from Microsoft's website that accompany the raw data, such as additional documents or reference materials. |

### Folder Details

- **Data/**  
  This folder stores the essential datasets used for analysis, including comprehensive Excel files like *Bulletin Search (2001 - 2008).xlsx* and *Bulletin Search (2008 - 2017).xlsx*, which list security bulletins issued by Microsoft over the years.

- **Data Analysis/**  
  Contains a single Excel file (or documentation) explaining each feature included in the datasets. This metadata file helps understand the meaning and relevance of the columns in the raw data.

- **Search Across Bulletins/**  
  This folder holds all related auxiliary files that came bundled with the raw data from Microsoftâ€™s site. These are supporting materials but do not include any scripts or analysis code.

This structured approach keeps raw data, documentation, and supplementary files well organized, making it easier to navigate and maintain the project.
