# Project Structure Overview

This project, **FinalProject-MSFT-AttackAnalysis**, is organized into several key directories that help manage data, analysis, and resources efficiently. Below is a description of each main folder and its purpose:

| Folder Name | Description                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Data/`     | Contains raw and processed datasets used for analysis, including Excel files with Microsoft security bulletins spanning different years. |
| `Data Analysis/` | (If applicable) Includes scripts, notebooks, or reports where the data is explored, cleaned, and visualized to extract insights. |
| `Search Across Bulletins/` | Holds tools or scripts to perform search operations across the extensive collection of security bulletins. |

### Folder Details

- **Data/**  
  This directory stores all primary data sources related to Microsoft security events. For example, it contains multiple Excel files segmented by year ranges such as *Bulletin Search (2001 - 2008).xlsx* and *Bulletin Search (2008 - 2017).xlsx*. These datasets form the foundation for further data preparation and modeling.

- **Data Analysis/**  
  This folder is dedicated to data exploration and preprocessing activities. Here you will find Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks used to understand patterns, clean data, and prepare it for modeling or reporting.

- **Search Across Bulletins/**  
  Contains utility scripts or tools that enable comprehensive querying and searching across the collected security bulletins, facilitating quick retrieval of relevant information.

This organized structure ensures clarity and efficiency in managing the different stages of the project lifecycle â€” from raw data ingestion through detailed analysis to final reporting.
