# Data Description and Analysis Importance

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset contains security update records for various software components in Microsoft operating systems.  
Each row represents a specific update and includes the following fields:

- **Bulletin ID** – The identifier for the security bulletin.  
- **KB Code** – The Knowledge Base number associated with the update.  
- **Severity** – The severity level of the vulnerability.  
- **Impact** – The nature of the vulnerability’s effect.  
- **Affected Product** – The operating system impacted by the vulnerability.  
- **Affected Component** – The software or hardware component related to the vulnerability.  
- **Reboot Required** – Indicates whether the update requires a system reboot.  
- **CVE Links** – References to CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) entries for further detail.

The data spans multiple Windows versions, including Windows 7, 8.1, 10, and various editions of Windows Server.  
Many of the updates are associated with **critical vulnerabilities**, such as **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**, which can allow attackers to execute malicious code remotely and gain unauthorized access to systems.
